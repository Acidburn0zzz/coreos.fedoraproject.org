  <h1>Welcome to Fedora CoreOS!</h1>
  <p><em>Note:</em> This site and project are currently very dynamic and will change a lot within the next weeks and months. Please refer to the <a href="/faq">FAQ</a> for more information for the time being. If you want to help or ask any questions, come by our IRC channel, irc://irc.freenode.org/#fedora-coreos, or join our new <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/coreos">discussion board</a>. Links to documentation and more will be added once they're available.</p>

  <!-- Note, this is a copy from the FAQ; change that one first -->
  <p>Fedora CoreOS aims to combine the best of both CoreOS Container Linux and Fedora Atomic Host. The two operating systems are very similar in goals and philosophy. Fedora CoreOS targets the same use case, combining technology like Ignition from Container Linux with the SELinux hardening from Project Atomic. Its goal is to provide the best container host to run containerized workloads securely and at scale.<p>

  <p>Fedora CoreOS is an open source project associated with the Fedora Project. We are aiming for high compatibility with existing Container Linux configuration and user experience, and we expect to provide documentation and tooling to help migrate from Container Linux to Fedora CoreOS.</p>
